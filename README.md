# Sorting Visualization

Inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's sorting visualisation [project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer), this is a much simpler version (just using basic HTML and JavaScript) of the same with an added feature of controlling the speed of the animation.

### How to use?

just do 
1. `git clone https://github.com/satyamx/vizsort.git` 
2. go into the vizsort directory and run `index.html` locally on your browser
3. play around
